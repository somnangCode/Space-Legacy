// Each item is plain data. The Explorer page (js/explorer.js) reads it and never needs code changes to add items.
// The facts were checked against the linked sources in October 2026 (see docs/RESEARCH.md).
//
// How to add an item: copy an entry and change it. Fields:
//   id          unique, lowercase
//   name        shown on the card
//   category    one of the CATEGORY ids below
//   mission     mission name
//   launchDate  text, e.g. "September 5, 1977" (launchYear is worked out from it)
//   rocket      id of a rocket item in this catalog (the launch vehicle), or null
//   vehicle     the launch vehicle as text, used when there is no rocket item
//   destination where it went. region = the filter group (see REGIONS)
//   bodies      solar-system bodies this item is shown under (planet info panel links)
//   status      { label, text, asOf }   label = Operating, Completed, Ended, Retired, On the surface
//   description, background, purpose   text
//   specs       [[label, value], ...]   only verified values
//   timeline    [{ date, text }, ...]
//   related     ids of related items
//   sources     [{ label, url }]
//   model       { type: "model" | "rocket", key }   key in js/models.js or js/rockets.js
//   image       { label, url }          link to an official image page (opened in a new tab, not copied)
//   hardware    id in data/hardware.js: the profile's summary, timeline, status and sources are reused
//   spacecraft  name in data/spacecraft.js (Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Parker Solar Probe): same idea
//   replay      how to replay the mission: { type: "hardware" | "mission" | "spacecraft", id }
//   landing     hardware id with a close-up landing scene
